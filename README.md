# Football Match Predictor
This project aims to look at previous football match results to make successful predictions for future matches. Therefore a large pool of data will be used as our basis. To do this, we will be using supervised machine learning to build an algorithm for the detection using Python programming.  
## Objective 
- Web-scraping to collect data of past football matches
- Supervised Machine Learning using detection models to predict the results of a football match on the basis of collected data
- Evaluation of the detection models
## Steps
There will be four key steps to completing this project, as detailed below
### 1) Web-Scraping
### 2) Data Pre-Processing
### 3) Implementing Prediction Models
### 4) Evaluating Results Using Metrics
